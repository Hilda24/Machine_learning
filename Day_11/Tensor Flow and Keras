Tensor Flow Learning updates for 10.04.21

Source : https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/pandas_dataframe

Things learnt : 
- Learned how to load pandas dataframe 
- Here we used a relatively small dataset provided by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation for Heart Disease.There are several hundred rows in the CSV. Each row describes a patient, and each column describes an attribute. We will use this information to predict whether a patient has heart disease, which in this dataset is a binary classification task.
- As the first step we download the dataset using tf.keras.get_file() function
- Then we read the csv file using read_csv ()
- Check if there is any object datatype in the dataframe. If so convert it into a dicrete numerical value
- Then we can finally load the data using tf.data.dataset
- One of the advantages of using tf.data.Dataset is it allows you to write simple, highly efficient data pipelines.
- Then as usual we can build the model with the loaded dataset and them compile it and finally fit our model to the data
