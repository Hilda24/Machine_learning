Things learned : 

- Learned that computer vision can not only be used for classification of images containing objects but also sounds 
- We can convert sounds into images by representing their frequencies
- By this method, we can achieve state of the art results in sound detection by using the same RESNET learner that can be used for image classification
- This has many applications - we can create images of gunshot, car horn and many more but the most important one is virus detection - we can classify differnet viruses with very high accuracy by using this method
- Learned about the different states of deep learning : 
  # Vision - Detection and classification
  # text - Detection and conversation
  # Tabular
  # Multi - modal
  # Others
