Tensor flow Learning updates for 03.04.21

Source : https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load

Things learnt : 
- Model progress can be saved during and after training. This means a model can resume where it left off and avoid long training times.
- Saving also means you can share your model and others can recreate your work.
- You can use a trained model without having to retrain it, or pick-up training where you left off in case the training process was interrupted. The tf.keras.callbacks.
- ModelCheckpoint callback allows you to continually save the model both during and at the end of training.
- As long as two models share the same architecture you can share weights between them. So, when restoring a model from weights-only, 
  create a model with the same architecture as the original model and then set its weights.
