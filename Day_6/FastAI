- Rather than depending upon the p-value to find the significance of our model, we should depend upon the actual output is our chosen relationship or equations between the different parameters is correct
- Steps used to turn a predictive model into something useful in production
- Learned how to gather data
- Learned how to build a model - Datablock API
- To export the model to any server so that it can be used as a pretrained program
