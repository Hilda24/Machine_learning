Tensor flow Learning updates for 05.04.21

Source : https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/keras_tuner

Things learnt : 
- The Keras Tuner is a library that helps you pick the optimal set of hyperparameters for your TensorFlow program.
- The process of selecting the right set of hyperparameters for your machine learning (ML) application is called hyperparameter tuning or hypertuning.
- Hyperparameters are the variables that govern the training process and the topology of an ML model. 
- These variables remain constant over the training process and directly impact the performance of your ML program. 
- When you build a model for hypertuning, you also define the hyperparameter search space in addition to the model architecture. The model you set up for hypertuning is called a hypermodel.
- You can define a hypermodel through two approaches:
  # By using a model builder function
  # By subclassing the HyperModel class of the Keras Tuner API
- Learned to create a hypermodel using the first method and used Hyperband which is one of the four tuners given to us by keras tuner API to tune the built machine
