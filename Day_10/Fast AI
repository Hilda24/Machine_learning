Things learned : 

- Learned about out of domain data - the data that we are trying to inference is on is in someway different than the data that was used to train the model
- Domain shift - At the starting the data will be in the main domaiin but as the time goes we will end up deviating from the domain
- Learned about Feedback loops - if they are left unnoticed the model might take a minor issue and explode it 
- The ways in which we have to solve the above problems are 
   # Manual process - Run the machine in parallel with human supervision
   # Limited Scope deployment - Under less human intervention but also with limited time and geography
   # Gradual Expansion - Good reporting system and considering what might go wrong.
