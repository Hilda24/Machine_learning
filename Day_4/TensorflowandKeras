Tensor flow Learning updates for 02.04.21

Source : https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression

Things learnt : 
- Learned the difference between regression and classification
- the aim is to predict the output of a continuous value, like a price or a probability
- Learned how to build and train a model to predict the fuel efficiency - used Auto MGP dataset
- Learnt about Seaborn - used for data visulazition
- Normalization - It is good practice to normalize features that use different scales and ranges.
- Although a model might converge without feature normalization, normalization makes training much more stable.
- Learned how to do regression using both Linear and DNN models
- Learned to store and reload models
