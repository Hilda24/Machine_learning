Things learned : 

- Learned more about overfitting
- Understood the basic structure to create and train a model
- Learner : contains the data and architecture 
- Metrics : It is function that measures the quality of the model's predictions using the validation set - FastAi automatically creates a validation set from the given dataset
- There is difference between the metric and loss function - metric is something we care about whereas loss is something the computer uses to check how well it is performing on a given task and seek to improve it
- Learned about Transfer Learning - Using a predefined model to do different task to what it was orginally trained for
- Learned about Fine tuning
