Tensor Flow Learning updates for 07.04.21

Source : https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images

Things learnt : 
- Learnt how to load and preprocess image dataset in three ways
  # Using keras preprocessing utilities and layers
  # Write our own pipeline from scratch using tf.data
  # Download from the large catalog available in TensorFlow Datasets
- Learnt to standardize the data - The RGB channel values are in the [0, 255] range. This is not ideal for a neural network;
  in general you should seek to make your input values small. Here, we will standardize values to be in the [0, 1] by using a Rescaling layer.
- These are two important methods you should use when loading data - cache and prefetch
- For finer control, we can write our own pipeline from scratch using tf.data.
