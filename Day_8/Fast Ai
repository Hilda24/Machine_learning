Things learned : 

- Image Classifier Clearner - we can clean the dataset after our model has been trained 
- it will display the images that the mofel is least confident about and you can choose whether or not to keep or delete it. 
- Learned more about voila - to see the working of our code with simple GUI components
- Learned how to export the model that we trained - so that we can use it just like anyother trained program in any server that we decide to run our application
- Learned how to deploy our notebooks using binder
