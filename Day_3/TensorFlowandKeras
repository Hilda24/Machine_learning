Tensor flow Learning updates for 01.04.21

Things learnt : 
- Learned about TensorFlow hub 
- The TensorFlow Hub lets you search and discover hundreds of trained, ready-to-deploy machine learning models in one place.
- The neural network is created by stacking layersâ€”this requires three main architectural decisions:
     # How to represent the text?
     # How many layers to use in the model?
     # How many hidden units to use for each layer?
- Use a pre-trained text embedding as the first layer, which will have three advantages:
    # You don't have to worry about text preprocessing,
    # Benefit from transfer learning,
    # the embedding has a fixed size, so it's simpler to process.
